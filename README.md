I am building this Slack App for the [Stellar Build Challenge](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/build/)

_Project Status: Works. I'm in the process of finishing it
up to hand it into the Slack App directory. So there might
be some things which change in the coming days. You can add
the Slack integration here:_
